This project combines the elements of HTML and CSS that we have learned thus far in the bootcamp. It further incorporates the use of Bootstrap, a tool that quickly styles pages with a general template. This will be the first draft of an ongoing portfolio that will be updated and further personalized as more skills and languages are learned. I chose to go with a classic layout that is user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. It is easily navigated on both desktop and mobile devices. Initially, I created the page before learning the grid format. I restyled it to meet the grid requirements. I am happy with the outcome, but will be excited to make a more stylistically sophisticated page that incorporates my own projects (rather than placeholders) in the coming weeks. The footer is currently a humorous element that will likely be changed when my portfolio is actually being used in my job search. I like that it adds some personality to the page and wanted to include the footer component, but am not sure that it will stay in its current state in the future.
