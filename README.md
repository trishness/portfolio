This project combines the elements of HTML and CSS that we have learned thus far in the bootcamp. It further incorporates the use of Bootstrap, a tool that quickly styles pages with a general template. This will be the first draft of an ongoing portfolio that will be updated and further personalized as more skills and languages are learned. I chose to go with a classic layout that is user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. It is easily navigated on both desktop and mobile devices. Initially, I created the page before learning the grid format. I restyled it to meet the grid requirements. I am happy with the outcome, but will be excited to make a more stylistically sophisticated page that incorporates my own projects (rather than placeholders) in the coming weeks.
